These techniques can be applied to a wide range of tasks, such as gathering data for analysis, automating data entry, or processing scanned documents. While web scraping can be challenging due to anti-scraping measures and website structure changes, and OCR accuracy can vary depending on image quality, these libraries provide powerful tools for tackling such problems programmatically."
